Student Performance Prediction Web Application
This project is a comprehensive machine learning web application designed to predict student academic performance based on a variety of behavioral, academic, and health-related factors. Built using Flask for the backend and a robust data science stack (including pandas, scikit-learn, and XGBoost), the application provides an interactive platform for educators, students, and researchers to analyze and forecast student scores.

Key Features
User-Friendly Web Interface: The app offers an intuitive interface for users to input student data and receive instant score predictions.
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: The project includes advanced data cleaning, handling of missing values, and creation of new features to improve model accuracy.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms for regression, with a pipeline that automates feature engineering, preprocessing, and prediction.
Model Evaluation: Provides metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² Score to assess model performance.
Feature Importance Visualization: Visualizes the most influential features affecting student performance, helping users understand key factors.
Database Integration: Uses Flask-SQLAlchemy for managing user data and predictions (if enabled).
Sample Dataset & Model: Includes a sample dataset and a pre-trained model for demonstration and testing purposes.
